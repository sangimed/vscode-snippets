Some personal Visual Studio Code snippets for lazy peoples.

## How to use them ? 

Just put the desired json file in your user's snippets location ('Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/Code/User/snippets' on windows). Then just let [Intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) do the rest :-)
